Package: **drift.proto.common**

## DriftPackage

A basic package for communication between services in PANDA|Drift infrastructure. All messages in Drift are wrapped into
it, so that the PANDA|Drift infrastructure can handle and store them.

## DataPayload

DataPayload represents serialized data which a server sends via MQTT. It is usually data denoised and compressed by
using [WaveletBuffer](https://github.com/panda-official/WaveletBuffer).

| Name  | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| shape | uint32 | Shape of real data. DEPRECATED  We use [MetProtocol](/docs/api/meta) to describe shape of data                                                                       |
| data  | byte[] | ialized binary data. It maybe JPEG picture, Wavelet Buffer, JSON string etc.   A service which subscribes on this data should know the format and how to process it. |

## StatusCode

Status of the package. Ok (0) means the package is valid and you can trust the data. Other code explains the reason why
the package is not valid. You should not use its data, however the service should publish an empty packages with the bad
status any way.
