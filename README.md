# Drift Protocol

Protobuf Libraries to encode message in [PANDA|Drift infrastructure](https://driftpythonclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/panda_drift/).
The libraries provide pre-generated Protobuf messages so that you don't need to install protobuf compiler and
generate them yourself.

## Implementations

* [For C++](cpp/README.md)
* [For Python](python/README.md)
